React cheat sheet and style guide being built as I learn it.

### 1. React binds to a single DOM element, e.g.

<body>
	<div id='root'></div>
</body>

<script type='text/babel'>
ReactDOM.render(
	//stuff ,
	document.getElementById('root')
);
</script>

### 2. Only one React component can be included in '// stuff'. This means that the root element needs to contain all the information needed to start the entire app, so:

<script type='text/babel'>
ReactDOM.render(
	<EntireApp anyDataPassedIn={whatever} />,
	document.getElementById('root')
);
</script>

### 3. Anything used in JS syntax within a JSX context needs to be enclosed in {}:

var whatever = {};

<EntireApp anyDataPassedIn={whatever} />, NOT <EntireApp anyDataPassedIn=whatever />,

### 4. Your typical react component definition looks like this:

<script type='text/babel'>
var SomeComponent = React.createClass({
	render: function() {
		return (
			<div className="some-component">
				// text
				// different components that live under this one
				// whatever
			</div>
		);
	},
	otherMethodsAndProperties: function () {}, etc.
});
</script>

The render method control the interaction of the virtualised component in React to what is contained in the actual HTML DOM.
