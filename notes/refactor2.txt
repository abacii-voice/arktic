The time has come again to refactor the code now that I am sure of what I want. Things seem to be working well, even on worse computers than mine.

ui.js:
1. Clarify special capabilities of defaultState, stateMap
2. Update template system.
3. Standard functions for commonly used structures.

main.css:
1. Need to get a handle on commonly styled boxes and buttons.
2. Global text colors and styles.

account.css:
1. Move specific component styling to static file

account.js:
1. Clean up components and layout.
