# On Phrases:
# I want Phrases to be another way of storing tokens. Not locked down to a caption.
# That way, users can store phrases that they see a lot.

# On Ghost Units:
# I think the caption units need to be rendered in a very similar manner to searchableList.
# A predetermined number (10) of units will be rendered with nothing in them.
# Then, they can be updated, but never removed.
# Three types:
# 1. Word
# 2. Tag
# 3. Ghost

# Ghost units are dimmed out
