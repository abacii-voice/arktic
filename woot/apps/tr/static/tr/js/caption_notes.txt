I need to understand the possibility space of the caption in order to make sure actions are consistent with one another.
Some actions can be unified and generalised.

Each caption unit does a very predictable set of things. Second order interactions are a little more complicated.
1. The unit must display the three fundamental parameters (query, complete, and type). For this reason, the base of a search field is used.
2. The query parameter must never be updated while the unit, and hence the head, is Focused.
3.

The key problem seems to be the speed at which the phrases and tokens are updated.
Perhaps a more efficient system for updating can be found. When splitting, the currently Focused unit will not change.
Yet, when splitting, it seems Focusing really throws it off.
