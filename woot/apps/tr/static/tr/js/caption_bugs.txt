1. One token
	a. empty
		i. click: ---
		ii. type: ---
	b. text
		i. backspace:
			tail not cleared when clearing all text.

		ii. blur, focus indirect:
			somehow duplicates list items.

		iii. blur:
			does not clear autocomplete.


Basically, I need to make sure exceptional methods are handled outside the main searchable list definition.
