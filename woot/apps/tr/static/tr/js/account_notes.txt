transcription interface elements
1. Counter
2. Autocomplete
3. Audio
4. Tokens
5. Original caption
6. Modified caption
7. Info panel
8. Previous button
9. Next button
10. Done button
11. Flags button

The point of user input is the Autocomplete. This is where all data added to the system is entered.

2016/7/7:
1. Fully construct token and rendered text fields with options.
2. Set up connection between search input and text fields.
3. Set up connection between modified caption and tokens (scroll to and edit).
4. Set up connection between original caption and tokens/modified (copy).
5. Set up states: transcription-state-interface, transcription-state-info,
6. Connection between done button and the counter

IDEA: Use current words to search database for transcriptions with similar words and add to autocomplete

rendered text field -> caption field
Still trying to do this caption field
Behaviour cases:

1. Focus autocomplete
	a. caption was focussed?

2. Focus caption (active token glued to caret)
	a. Make token active

3. Input autocomplete
	a. beginning of active token -> previous |active
	b. in the middle -> a|ctive
	c. at the end -> active| next

4. Input caption
	a. beginning of active token -> previous |active
	b. in the middle -> a|ctive
	c. at the end -> active| next
